Bookstore Web Application
### **Description**
This project was developed as a practice exercise to evaluate the knowledge acquired in the classroom about JavaScript, particularly focusing on manipulating list data and adding various functionalities such as delete and add buttons. The main goal was to create a web application that allows users to manage a list of books in a bookstore.

## **Key Features: **
Add, Edit, and Delete Books: Users can add new books, edit existing ones, and delete books from the list.

Dynamic Updates: The task list is dynamically updated using the DOM.

Basic Styling: The application includes basic styles for the task list to improve user experience.

Responsive Design: The web page is designed to be responsive, ensuring it works well on different screen sizes.

## **Requirements**
The following requirements were provided for this project:

Allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks (using the same input and prompt).

Use the DOM to dynamically update the task list.

Implement basic styles for the task list.

Code Structure
HTML
Contains the structure of the web page, including input fields, buttons, and the book list.

CSS
Provides basic styling for the page and ensures it is responsive.

JavaScript
Handles the logic for adding, editing, and deleting books.

Dynamically updates the DOM to reflect changes in the book list.

Responsive Design
The web page is designed to be responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop). This was achieved using CSS media queries and flexible layouts.

Extra Features
